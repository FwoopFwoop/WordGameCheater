Generate a list of all (scrabble) dictionary words that can be made from a set of letters.

I realized while playing WordCookies Crossword that it is very easy for a computer to find words that are constructed from a limited set of letters, something which is at the heart of many different word-based games.

Planned additions include for the program to run properly as command line program with arguments, as well as a -scrabble argument that will  sort words by point values. By default, the program will output words sorted by length, then by alphabetical order.
